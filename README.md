# Source-Texture-Extractor
Simple python script that will copy textures used by a Garry's Mod or any other Source game's map/model to the target directory

## What is this script?
This script is for lazy people that can't be bothered to search for every single file that they used as custom content.
For example you can use this tool if you just finished creating a hammer map and you've put every single material file inside the materials folder of the game, you would just run this script and every file you used on your map will be copied over to a folder you specify.

## Install
To run this script you need colorama you can install this via pip
```bash
$ pip install colorama
```

## How to use it
It's simple, run ``map.py`` if you want to get your materials from a map. This only works with a decompiled bsp (or a hammer save.)
